- Straight away solving the problem is not possible, it works like learn the basic structures, algorithms, patterns
and practice it. eg:- like maths, where without the theory part and basic working part, the complex problems 
cannot be solved.
- Regular **revisiting** and **documenting** the work or progress is very important.
- While learning write down the whole concept and outline and keep it safe for reference, learning and documenting is
  like two eyes of learning the new skill (while learning spring boot where I have learned two times, as I have not documented
  and **revisited** and **outlined**).
- Pictorial representation of the entire work is very important use draw.io for making diagrams and keep it along the problem files.
- Pictorial representation plays a major role in recollecting the problem mindset, when we solved the problem.
- Keep **outline** of the whole process very important either points or structured representation.
- At last write down the problems after the process is over.

> **_NOTE:_**  The Process can be anything like project, company project, learning. without these steps, it is totally waste of time
> eg:- if I did not learn DSA while clg, it would have become big strategy while learning for interview.
