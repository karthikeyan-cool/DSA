- Straight away solving the problem is not possible, it works like learn the basic structures, algorithms, patterns
and practice it. eg:- like maths, where without the theory part and basic working part, the complex problems 
cannot be solved.
- Regular **revisiting** and **documenting** the work or progress is very important.
- While learning write down the whole concept and outline and keep it safe for reference, learning and documenting is
like two eyes of learning the new skill (while learning spring boot where I have learned two times, as I have not documented
and **revisited** and **outlined**).
